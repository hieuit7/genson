_<font color='red'>Genson website has moved to <a href='http://owlike.github.io/genson/'>http://owlike.github.io/genson/</a> and the code is hosted on GitHub at <a href='https://github.com/owlike/genson'>https://github.com/owlike/genson</a></font>_

This part of the wiki is not yet ready.
However the javadoc contains all the necessary.

Have a look at [ChainedFactory](http://genson.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/owlike/genson/convert/ChainedFactory.html) if you want to add new features to conversion.

Look at the interfaces and classes from [reflect package](http://genson.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/owlike/genson/reflect/package-summary.html) if you want to add some advanced customization to Bean conversion.
If for example you want to use only properties that have a field, a getter and setter you can add a custom [BeanMutatorAccessorResolver](http://genson.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/owlike/genson/reflect/BeanMutatorAccessorResolver.html) implementation.

If you need to change something in the streaming api look at the classes from [stream package](http://genson.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/owlike/genson/stream/package-summary.html).
