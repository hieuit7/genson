Genson provides two kind of integrations with the JSR. You can use Genson as the JSR implementation or use Genson to work with the DOM structures defined in the JSR.

# Using Genson as JSR 353 implementation #

Since version 0.99 Genson provides a complete implementation of JSR 353. To use Genson implementation, you only need it on your classpath.


# Using JSR 353 types with Genson #

Starting with release 0.98 Genson provides a bundle JSR353Bundle that enables support of JSR 353 types in Genson. This means that you can ser/deser using those types but also mix them with the databinding mechanism.
```
 Genson genson = new Genson.Builder().with(new JSR353Bundle()).create();
 JsonObject object = genson.deserialize(json, JsonObject.class);
```

You can also mix with standard Pojos.

```
 class Pojo {
  public String aString;
  public JsonArray someArray;
 }

Pojo pojo = genson.deserialize(json, Pojo.class);
```
